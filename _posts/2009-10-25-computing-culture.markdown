I subscribe to the theory that the 
[gender gap in computing is cultural][1].  And this is a good thing! Culture is dynamic. It's easier to hope to see cultural change than to see female brains evolve to be better suited to computing.  I'm also biased.  I'd rather not believe my brain is sort of male, or that maybe it really isn't up to the job it's trying to do.   At some point in the past I wasn't so sure about this, but I discovered that there is only a dearth of women in computing in certain countries, particularly western ones.  It can't be the case that only western women have a certain kind of brain.

[Women in Mathematics][2] by Andrea Lenzner cites statistics on the percentage of women in math and computer science around the world and considers the cultural differences that support these differences. In some counties women outnumber men in Computer Science and Mathematics programs.

It seems easy to get sucked into approaching the gap in a negative way, like focusing on [sexist incidents][3] or the demanding nature of the field, what keeps women out.  Not to say, the bad stuff should be ignored, not at all.  But it seems productive to focus on what makes some cultures attract more women.  Look for the good stuff that we can promote and emulate.

Much work has been done for over a decade at [Carnegie Mellon][4] on the topic of gender gap in computing.  [Carol Frieze][5] has a particularly compelling paper called [A Cultural Perspective on Gender Diversity in Computing][10].

It's not only cultural, it's subcultural. Kirrily Roberts gave a 
[keynote speech at OSCON '09][6].  She confronts the fact that the number of women in the open source community is particularly dismal, less than two percent.

Many participants in open source projects work in their [leisure time][7], where there is also a gender gap.

It's heartening to see some active promotion of change, like in the [python][8] and [ruby][9] communities.
