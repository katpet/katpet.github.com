   <h3>Plastic Brains</h3>
    <h4>Posted  on <a href="/books/brain/2010/01/19/plastic-brains.html" title="Permalink for this post">19 Jan 2010</a></h4>

    <p>I&#8217;m grateful for Clay Shirky&#8217;s recent <a href='http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/01/a-rant-about-women'>rant about women</a>, even though it&#8217;s a little embarrassing to read. This comment gets at why:</p>
<blockquote>
DRST: I think you rather desperately need to Google “Unpacking the Invisible Backpack” read it. Then think about it for a good long time before you post again.</blockquote>
<p>So, even though I would have hoped he might be more informed on the phenomenon of women seeming to be less assertive and risk taking than men, or would have done some research before tossing up his rant, I&#8217;m delighted that he&#8217;s stumbled upon an interest in the subject. Undoubtedly, he&#8217;ll soon be very informed. He&#8217;s doing an excellent job of moderating the heap of comments.</p>

<p>It may well be good advice that women should be more assertive, or that men should avoid being overbearing. Forget analyzing why people are this way, focus on moving yourself forward. While I love that positive attitude, I&#8217;m also fascinated with the cultural conditions which cultivate these tendencies of men and women. In <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Pink-Brain-Blue-Differences-Troublesome/dp/0618393110'>Pink Brain, Blue Brain</a>, Lise Eliot talks about brain plasticity, how what we do, which is certainly influenced by culture, shapes our brains. Boys and girls may be born with certain genetic tendencies, but those become exaggerated by experience in ways that are not necessarily inevitable.</p>
