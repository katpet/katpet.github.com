      <p>I&#8217;m grateful for Clay Shirky&#8217;s recent <a href='http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/01/a-rant-about-women'>rant about women</a>, even though it&#8217;s a little embarrassing to read. This comment gets at why:</p>
<blockquote>
DRST: I think you rather desperately need to Google “Unpacking the Invisible Backpack” read it. Then think about it for a good long time before you post again.</blockquote>
<p>So, even though I would have hoped he might be more informed on the phenomenon of women seeming to be less assertive and risk taking than men, or would have done some research before tossing up his rant, I&#8217;m delighted that he&#8217;s stumbled upon an interest in the subject. Undoubtedly, he&#8217;ll soon be very informed. He&#8217;s doing an excellent job of moderating the heap of comments.</p>

<p>It may well be good advice that women should be more assertive, or that men should avoid being overbearing. Forget analyzing why people are this way, focus on moving yourself forward. While I love that positive attitude, I&#8217;m also fascinated with the cultural conditions which cultivate these tendencies of men and women. In <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Pink-Brain-Blue-Differences-Troublesome/dp/0618393110'>Pink Brain, Blue Brain</a>, Lise Eliot talks about brain plasticity, how what we do, which is certainly influenced by culture, shapes our brains. Boys and girls may be born with certain genetic tendencies, but those become exaggerated by experience in ways that are not necessarily inevitable.</p>

      <h3><a href="/books/stereotype/2009/12/12/stereotype-threat.html">Stereotype Threat</a></h3>
      <h4>Posted  on 12 Dec 2009</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="item_content">
      <p>In the latest <a href='http://herbsutter.wordpress.com/2009/12/11/guest-blog-words-matter/'>post</a> over at Sutter&#8217;s Mill, Sutter&#8217;s colleague, Robert Hanz, wonders regarding Agile terminology:</p>
<blockquote>...is it possible that something as simple as the shift in language is also a significant part of the effectiveness? That by priming individuals with messages of success and value, rather than messages of failure, that morale and productivity can be boosted?</blockquote>
<p>In sharp contrast, this reminded me of a part of the Jamie Zawinski interview in <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Coders-at-Work-Peter-Seibel/dp/1430219483/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1260601509&amp;amp;sr=1-1'>Coders at Work</a>:</p>
<blockquote>It was really a great environment.  I really enjoyed it.  Because everyone was so sure they were right, we fought constantly but it allowed us to communicate fast.  Someone would lean over your cubicle and say, "What the fuck did you check in; that's complete bullshit -- you can't do it that way.  You're an idiot."  And you'd say, "Fuck off!" and go look at it and fix it and check it in.  We were very abrasive but we communicated fast because you didn't have to go blow sunshine up someone's ass and explain to them what you thought was wrong -- you could say, "Hey, that's a load of shit!  I can't use that."  And you'd hash it out very quickly.  It was stressful but we got it done pretty quickly.
</blockquote>
<p>Zawinski&#8217;s description of his cursing coworkers cracks me up. It got me thinking that his group must have had a lot of trust, assuming the yelling wasn&#8217;t all handed down one way. I can see how this could be a good thing. This style also reminds me of what I&#8217;ve read about <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Show-Stopper-Breakneck-Generation-Microsoft/dp/0029356717/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1260603182&amp;amp;sr=1-1'>David Cutler</a>. On the other hand, maybe it&#8217;s not as ideal as he made it out. Later in the interview he described eventually working with a guy who he got along with extremely well, and they just went about dividing up work without any drama.</p>

<p>The other thing the Sutter&#8217;s Mill post reminds me of is the phenomenon of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat'>stereotype threat</a>, where people who are reminded of a negative stereotype regarding their group are affected in subsequent performance. The idea of negativity in the workplace affecting performance is familiar to experts on diversity. Here is a good article: <a href='http://www.wu.ac.at/gender/lehre/roberson_kulik.pdf'>Stereotype Threat at Work</a>.</p>

      <h3><a href="/books/women/2009/12/06/turnips-and-oysters.html">Turnips And Oysters</a></h3>
      <h4>Posted  on 06 Dec 2009</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="item_content">
      <p>Latest on the revolving pile of library books is <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Women-Dont-Ask-Negotiation-Strategies/dp/0553383876/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1260123363&amp;amp;sr=8-1'>Women Don&#8217;t Ask</a>. Why didn&#8217;t I read this years ago? The insights are so obvious, yet I never really connected all the dots before or realized research confirms various inklings.</p>

<p>Girls grow up learning to play by the rules, and expecting boys to take the lead in many areas. By elementary school girls and boys already associate femininity with restriction and boundaries while maleness is associated with independence and opportunity. In addition to these developing gender schemas it has been found that girls favor structure in their play, while boys favor open, unstructured play. While it&#8217;s not entirely clear what causes this, whether it&#8217;s entirely cultural or partially genetic, it shapes their world view as adults. Girls are used to playing by rules, which are perceived to be out of their control. They learn to wait to be noticed and rewarded based on what other people think of them, whether it be in dating or school work. They also learn that their work often doesn&#8217;t have a monetary value, like housework versus the kinds of chores people like to pay a kid to do, like mowing the lawn or washing the car.</p>

<p>The authors describe a spectrum of world views ranging from &#8220;can&#8217;t squeeze blood out of a turnip&#8221; to &#8220;the world is my oyster&#8221;. Studies show that women lean toward turnip, and men toward oyster. These world views affect the course of people&#8217;s lives. Men make more money and get more promotions because they ask for more money from the start. While women tend to have the attitude that they&#8217;re not really in control of things like that, and they hope that according to the rules of fairness, people will be promoted based on merit.</p>
