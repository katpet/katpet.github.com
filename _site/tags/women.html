      <p>Latest on the revolving pile of library books is <a href='http://www.amazon.com/Women-Dont-Ask-Negotiation-Strategies/dp/0553383876/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;s=books&amp;amp;qid=1260123363&amp;amp;sr=8-1'>Women Don&#8217;t Ask</a>. Why didn&#8217;t I read this years ago? The insights are so obvious, yet I never really connected all the dots before or realized research confirms various inklings.</p>

<p>Girls grow up learning to play by the rules, and expecting boys to take the lead in many areas. By elementary school girls and boys already associate femininity with restriction and boundaries while maleness is associated with independence and opportunity. In addition to these developing gender schemas it has been found that girls favor structure in their play, while boys favor open, unstructured play. While it&#8217;s not entirely clear what causes this, whether it&#8217;s entirely cultural or partially genetic, it shapes their world view as adults. Girls are used to playing by rules, which are perceived to be out of their control. They learn to wait to be noticed and rewarded based on what other people think of them, whether it be in dating or school work. They also learn that their work often doesn&#8217;t have a monetary value, like housework versus the kinds of chores people like to pay a kid to do, like mowing the lawn or washing the car.</p>

<p>The authors describe a spectrum of world views ranging from &#8220;can&#8217;t squeeze blood out of a turnip&#8221; to &#8220;the world is my oyster&#8221;. Studies show that women lean toward turnip, and men toward oyster. These world views affect the course of people&#8217;s lives. Men make more money and get more promotions because they ask for more money from the start. While women tend to have the attitude that they&#8217;re not really in control of things like that, and they hope that according to the rules of fairness, people will be promoted based on merit.</p>
